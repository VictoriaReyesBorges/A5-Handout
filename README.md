## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Chiashi Yang - Overall, I really enjoyed this assignmnet. My particular role was to work on the infixtoPostfix method. I found it to be challenging but still fun to code. I learned a lot about coding PEMDAS and ensuring that it actually goes in the right order. It made me feel accomplished at the end when my group and I succesfully coded and everything was operating correctly. I do wish the instructions were a little more clear, particularly with what to code for the associativity section. However, we were able to figure it out.

Victoria Reyes Borges - This assignment was interesting to work on. I liked that we got to work on something that most people in the CS industry have done/also worked on and getting to learn different types of implementation. I had trouble implemeting the right and left associativity part of the assignment since the instructions were a little blunt. However, with help from my teammates we were able to work it out and learn something new.

Kiara Singh - Overall, I found this assignment to be very helpful with learning more about how stacks and queues operate in a real-world setting. I personally worked on the CalculatePostFix class and initially found it difficult to organize the logic correctly when it came to popping off of the stack, but after some attempts I was able to write the method correctly. Working in a team definitely helped me troubleshoot most of my logical errors and misunderstandings.

Any questions you still have?
