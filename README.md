## Reflection

Reflection on your experience with this assignment:

Chiashi Yang - Overall, I really enjoyed this assignmnet. My particular role was to work on the infixtoPostfix method. I found it to be challenging but still fun to code. I learned a lot about coding PEMDAS and ensuring that it actually goes in the right order. It made me feel accomplished at the end when my group and I succesfully coded and everything was operating correctly. I do wish the instructions were a little more clear, particularly with what to code for the associativity section. However, we were able to figure it out.

Any questions you still have?
